<h1> Lines of Action </h1>

<p> 
  Lines of Action (LOA) is a board game invented by Claude Soucie.
</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>
  The game ends when one side's pieces are contiguous: that is, there is a path connecting any two
  pieces of that side's color by a sequence of steps to adjacent squares (horizontally, vertically,
  or diagonally), each of which contains a piece of same color.
</p>
<h3>Moves</h3>
<p>
  Pieces are moved in a straight line (vertical, horizontal or diagonal), exactly as many squares as
  there are pieces of either color anywhere along the line of movement.

  A moved piece cannot land on a square occupied by one piece of the same color.
  However, opponent pieces can be captured by landing on them.

  A moved piece may jump over pieces of the same color, but not over opponent pieces.
</p>
<h3>Win Condition</h3>
<p>
  The player whose pieces are all in one contiguous region wins.

  If a move simultaneously creates a win for both players, the player who has made the move is the winner.

  If the moves exceed the move limit, the game ends in a draw.

</p>
<h2>Controlling Play</h2>
<p>
 To operate the graphical user interface, simply click on the piece you want to move and drag it to the square that you want to drop it in.
  If the move is illegal, nothing will happen.
  You can also click the undo button, to undo the last two moves, one white move and one black move.
  If you want to start a new game, click the game drop down menu and click new.
  If you want to quit the game, click the game drop down menu and click quit.
  The original configuration is that Black is manual and White is automated,
  however, this can be changed through the Switch Players menu button.
